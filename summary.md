# Linux Environment Setup Summary

In this task, I installed Ubuntu Linux and practiced basic Linux commands.
I learned how to navigate directories, create files, manage permissions,
and monitor system resources using commands like top, df, and free.

This task helped me gain confidence in working with Linux systems,
which is essential for DevOps roles.
